我现在在哪个分支开发，你能看到吗，是不是这个进度：

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Confirming project progress**

The user is asking if this is the correct progress. To confirm, I should inspect the code by searching through changes. They want clear confirmation, so I could run a search for the BottomNav test file issues. It might be simpler to show the current branch and list recent commits. I need to ensure that tasks are completed, including checking the outstanding items. I'll clarify that I can verify file existence but can't directly see the progress status without a tracker.
**Checking developer tools usage**

I should use developer tools, specifically todo_write, for complex tasks, but since this is a simple information request, I can skip that. I might check git branches and commit messages related to "BottomNav." Running commands like git log could help, but it's not strictly necessary. Instead, I'll run commands to check the current branch, status updates, and recent commits. This should help confirm any uncommitted changes, especially as the user could be on an automatically created branch.
**Running git commands**

I need to run the command git branch -a to check all branches, both local and remote. This will help me understand the branch situation better. I’ll use run_terminal_cmd to execute this command. It’s crucial to gather accurate information about the branches available, so I can assess the user's current development context effectively. Let’s execute that command and see what comes up!</details></think>

我先查一下当前 Git 分支与工作区状态，然后再确认你说的进度是否匹配。
