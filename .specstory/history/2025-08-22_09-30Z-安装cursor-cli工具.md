<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Installing cursor cli**

I need to help install "cursor cli" for the user on Windows PowerShell 7 in the D:\SummerVacationPlanning path. I can propose commands using my tool to run terminal commands, but I'll need the user's approval since I'm cautious about running commands directly. I want to clarify what "cursor cli" actually is. It seems Cursor has a CLI option for login and authorization, and there might be a "cursor" command or an npm package related to it.
**Installing Cursor CLI on Windows**

To install the Cursor CLI on Windows, I need to check if it adds itself to the PATH during installation, similar to how it works on macOS. There might also be an option to install the command via a shell command. I should verify if the "cursor-cli" tool is the right one to use by searching online. I can utilize functions to run commands like `winget install`, but it seems "Cursor.Cursor" only installs the app, not the CLI. The CLI should come with the app and provide the "cursor" command for terminal access.
**Setting Up Cursor CLI**

To set up the Cursor CLI on Windows, I can either create a symlink or path entry that points to Cursor.exe with an argument to open a specific path. However, the best practice might be to enable "Install 'cursor' command in PATH" from within the app. It's possible that the user expects to install the "cursor" CLI using winget or choco. If Cursor is already installed, I should check the local app data for the CLI files and add them to the PATH if needed.
**Searching for Cursor CLI**

I’m planning to search for "Cursor CLI Windows cursor.cmd" online. This should help me find valuable information about the installation and usage of the Cursor CLI on Windows. By searching for these specific terms, I can discover guides or documentation that clarify how to properly set up and access the Cursor command. Hopefully, this will provide me with all the details I need to assist the user effectively!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Installing Cursor CLI**

I need to install "cursor cli" on the user's Windows system. They use PowerShell 7 and want me to run the necessary commands. I see there are specific repo automation rules they provided for GitHub issues, but my focus is on this task. I can use the functions.run_terminal_cmd tool to execute commands, ensuring I get the correct installation method. I'm a bit uncertain if it’s "cursor", "cursor-agent", or something else altogether. Let’s clarify that!
**Installing Cursor CLI on Windows**

The Cursor Editor includes the "cursor" CLI command, which is similar to the "code" command in VS Code. To install the "cursor" command on Windows, I believe there's an option in the editor's menu for "Shell Command: Install 'cursor' command in PATH." The installation path usually looks like "C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Cursor\bin." I'm wondering if there’s a separate CLI or just "cursor.cmd." We should focus on getting the user's command in place, as they requested.
**Installing Cursor CLI and Setting PATH**

I can use winget to install Cursor and set the PATH variable, but the user is already in the Cursor chat, so they likely have it installed. The issue might be that the CLI isn't accessible. We can use "Shell command: Install 'cursor' command in PATH," but that's a UI action. Instead, I'll add "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Cursor\bin" to the PATH for the current user. 

My plan is to verify if the 'cursor' command exists by running "where cursor" and "cursor --version." If it’s not found, I’ll check the installation paths. If the path is confirmed, I can update the user PATH persistently. I have to be cautious with the length limits using setx, but it’s generally simpler.
**Handling Windows Limitations and Commands**

I need to be cautious about Windows limitations when setting the PATH and appending values. I can use PowerShell to check if 'cursor.cmd' exists in the expected directory. If it’s not found, I might install Cursor using winget with the appropriate flags.

After the installation, it's important to verify that the CLI works by running commands like 'cursor --version' or 'cursor --help.' I want to avoid confusion with "cursor-agent" since the request is generic. We’ll run commands step by step, providing status updates as needed, and maybe consider using parallelization for efficiency.
**Checking for Cursor Command**

I’m planning to check if the 'cursor' command already exists. I'll run detection commands in parallel for efficiency, including 'where cursor' and 'Get-Command cursor'. Given that 'run_terminal_cmd' can only handle one command at a time, I’ll call multiple commands parallel using 'multi_tool_use.parallel'. 

The first step includes a quick update to inform the user in Chinese, stating I’ll check for the 'cursor' command. If it's found, I'll ensure it's added to PATH; if not, I'll proceed to install it using winget. 

Let's get started with the detection commands first!</details></think>

我先在 PowerShell 中检查是否已经存在 `cursor` 命令以及常见安装路径，然后再决定是否执行安装。随后会总结每一步命令的输出与结果。

---

```bash
Get-Command cursor -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source | cat
```

```

Get-Content: The input object cannot be bound to any parameters for the command
either because the command does not take pipeline input or the input and its pro
perties do not match any of the parameters that take pipeline input.
