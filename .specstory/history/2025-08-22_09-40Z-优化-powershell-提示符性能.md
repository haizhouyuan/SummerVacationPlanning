# 优化 PowerShell 提示符性能 (2025-08-22 09:40Z)

_**User**_

为改善 PowerShell 提示符迟缓的问题，可以从以下几个方面入手：

1. 优化或禁用 posh-git/oh-my-posh 提示符功能

减少提示符获取的信息量是提升速度的直接手段。具体可以采取：

禁用文件变更状态显示： 如果使用 posh-git，可以设置仅显示当前分支名称而不显示具体变更统计。posh-git 提供了配置开关来针对特定仓库禁用文件状态扫描。例如，将慢的仓库路径加入全局变量：

$GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus += "C:\path\to\your\repo"


这样posh-git在该仓库就不统计+A ~B -C这些状态，只显示分支名，从而避免了大量文件扫描
dahlbyk.github.io
。对于oh-my-posh，可以在其配置JSON中将Git段的 "display_status" 设为 false（或通过 "fetch_status": false 禁用远程状态获取）
stackoverflow.com
。总之，精简提示符信息到仅包含必要内容（比如分支名称）能显著提升刷新速度。

关闭远程状态检查： 如前述，oh-my-posh 默认可能检查远程同步情况。通过 "fetch_status": false 可关闭之
stackoverflow.com
。posh-git本身默认不主动 git fetch，但会通过比较本地分支上次拉取位置判断 ahead/behind（这不需要联网，但需要遍历提交记录）。如果不关心这些信息，也可以通过配置 $GitPromptSettings.ShowStatusWhenZero = $false 等方式简化提示符。也可以考虑完全禁用远程分支对比，只显示本地分支名。

升级或更换提示符工具： 确保使用最新版的 posh-git/oh-my-posh，因为新版本可能在性能上有改进。如果 posh-git 性能仍不理想，可以尝试更轻量的方案。例如，一些用户自己实现了一个简单Prompt：每次仅调用一次轻量的Git命令获取当前分支名称，而不做其他扫描，从而几乎与git bash速度相当
haacked.com
。比如可以自定义 PowerShell 提示符函数为：

function prompt {
    $branch = $(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>$null) 
    "$pwd$([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($branch) ? '>' : " [$branch]> ")"
}


这将通过读取 Git HEAD 引用快速得到分支名（在非Git目录下则不显示分支），避免完整的git status扫描。实测这种简化Prompt在大型仓库下延迟极小。当然，代价是失去了变更提示等附加信息，但如果优先考虑速度，这是值得权衡的取舍。

按需加载posh-git： 如果并非每个PowerShell会话都需要Git提示符，可以考虑在进入Git仓库时才临时加载posh-git模块。例如，可以从配置文件中移除自动加载，在需要时手动运行 Import-Module posh-git。或者利用 Powershell 的自动加载功能：只有当调用了与posh-git相关的命令（如 git status 别名）时才加载模块。不过，这对提示符本身的影响有限，因为一旦加载posh-git并启用提示符，后续每次prompt都会参与计算。

检查模块冲突： 确认没有同时启用重复的提示符模块。若使用oh-my-posh，就不应再加载posh-git的prompt（oh-my-posh可以兼容posh-git的补全功能，但不要重复定义prompt）。保证Prompt函数只有一个来源，才能避免重复计算浪费。Oh-my-posh官网也提醒，他们会自动引入posh-git模块来提供tab补全等功能，这有时也会产生额外开销
ohmyposh.dev
。如果发现在 oh-my-posh 下posh-git拖慢了shell，可以考虑完全移除posh-git，仅用oh-my-posh自带的Git段显示信息。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Configuring PowerShell settings**

I think we can provide commands for adding posh-git disable settings to the PowerShell profile and an oh-my-posh config snippet for the Git segment with `display_status` and `fetch_status` set to false. It might be helpful to run commands that check installed modules and find the `$PROFILE` path before backing it up. We should also make sure the settings for posh-git are accurate, using known documented properties to avoid any mishaps. Let's ensure we cover how to revert if needed.
**Adjusting oh-my-posh configuration**

I’m considering the challenges with editing the oh-my-posh config JSON because the theme path isn't easily accessible; it tends to be in `\AppData\Local\Programs\oh-my-posh\themes`. Users are more likely to use `\Documents\PowerShell\omp.json`. I can suggest minimal JSON segments along with commands like `oh-my-posh config export` or `Get-PoshThemes`. 

Oh, and since oh-my-posh v7 uses a different initialization command, we might provide clear steps for creating or adjusting JSON files. For flexibility, I'll also propose a function that enables users to bypass modules temporarily with some straightforward commands.
**Deciding on todo lists and commands**

I’m thinking about whether to create a todo list for this task. The guidelines suggest using todos for multi-step processes, but since this is more about providing guidance rather than code edits, I can skip creating a todo list. The developer instructions allow me to bypass it for simpler tasks. 

Now, I need to decide if we should run commands. Given that the user’s environment is Windows and commands that change the profile could modify their system, I should propose the commands without executing them. I’ll present practical steps with code blocks for PowerShell and JSON.
**Providing streamlined commands**

I want to keep my instructions concise while giving the user useful "one-click" commands for posh-git to disable file status. I'll need to provide example paths and placeholders for clarity. It might also be good to include a function called `Use-FastPrompt` for switching to a minimal prompt in the current session, along with steps for restoring the default prompt.

I’ll create a simple oh-my-posh Git segment config example to set `display_status` and `fetch_status` to false. I need to include a clear JSON structure without unnecessary options and avoid risky environment variables like `POSH_GIT_ENABLED`. I'll stick to safe recommendations.</details></think>

### 直接给出可操作的最小改动（优先快）

- **超轻量自定义 Prompt（仅显示当前路径 + Git 分支名）**
  将下列函数加入你的 PowerShell 配置文件（不会再做任何仓库扫描，基本零延迟）：
```powershell
function prompt {
    $branch = $(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>$null)
    "$pwd$([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($branch) ? '>' : " [$branch]> ")"
}
```
- **启用**：把上面函数追加到 `$PROFILE` 后，新开一个窗口或执行 `. $PROFILE`。
- **还原**：`Remove-Item function:prompt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`，然后重新加载 posh-git/oh-my-posh 的初始化语句（如果需要）。

---

### 在保留现有工具的前提下做“轻量化”

#### 1) posh-git：禁止慢仓库的文件状态扫描，仅看分支
- 把“慢仓库”的路径加入禁用扫描列表（只显示分支名，不统计 +A ~B -C）：
```powershell
$GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus += "C:\path\to\your\repo"
```
- 精简零状态显示，减少无意义信息：
```powershell
$GitPromptSettings.ShowStatusWhenZero = $false
```
说明：
- 第一条能显著减少大型/大量文件仓库的扫描时间。
- 第二条不会再显示“0 修改/0 提交”等无用信息。

建议把这些行放进 `$PROFILE`，永久生效：
```powershell
if ($null -eq $GitPromptSettings) { Import-Module posh-git -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue }
$GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus += "C:\path\to\your\repo"
$GitPromptSettings.ShowStatusWhenZero = $false
```

#### 2) oh-my-posh：禁用 Git 状态与远程检查
- 若你用的是 oh-my-posh，请在其配置 JSON 的 Git 段设置：
```json
{
  "type": "git",
  "style": "plain",
  "properties": {
    "display_status": false,
    "fetch_status": false
  }
}
```
- 如果你还没有自定义配置，可导出/创建一个并在 `$PROFILE` 中使用：
```powershell
# 假设使用自定义配置路径
$ompCfg = "$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\omp.json"
oh-my-posh config export --format json | Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 $ompCfg
# 然后手动在 $ompCfg 中找到 "git" 段，按上面修改
# 在 $PROFILE` 中使用自定义配置：
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config $ompCfg | Invoke-Expression
```

---

### 避免冲突与“重复计算”

- 两者不要同时定义 prompt：若使用 oh-my-posh，请避免让 posh-git 也接管 prompt。
- 快速自查当前谁接管了 prompt：
```powershell
Get-Command prompt
Get-Module posh-git, oh-my-posh
```
- 当会话中临时停用：
```powershell
Remove-Module posh-git -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
# oh-my-posh 没有“禁用命令”，只要不要 init 或临时移除 prompt 函数即可
Remove-Item function:prompt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

---

### 按需加载（不在每个会话都加载）

- 不在 `$PROFILE` 里自动 `Import-Module posh-git` 或初始化 oh-my-posh。
- 需要时再临时启用：
```powershell
Import-Module posh-git
# 或
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config $HOME\Documents\PowerShell\omp.json | Invoke-Expression
```

---

### 升级与验证

- 升级到最新版（常有性能改进）：
```powershell
# 需要管理员或允许当前用户作用域
Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser -Force
winget upgrade JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh
```
- 粗略测量 Prompt 耗时（多次取平均）：
```powershell
1..10 | ForEach-Object { (Measure-Command { prompt | Out-Null }).TotalMilliseconds } | Measure-Object -Average -Minimum -Maximum
```

---

### 推荐的最小改动顺序（安全且见效快）

1) 先用自定义超轻量 `prompt`（上面的函数），确认大型仓库下卡顿消失。  
2) 若想保留主题/图标，再逐步恢复 oh-my-posh，并把 Git 段设置 `"display_status": false, "fetch_status": false`。  
3) 对极慢仓库，额外在 posh-git 配置中把该仓库加入 `RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus`。  
4) 确保只保留一个 Prompt 来源，避免重复计算。

- **核心结论**：最有效的提速方式是“只显示分支名，不做状态扫描”。需要信息越少，Prompt 越快。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering PowerShell slowness**

I need to execute actions to improve PowerShell prompt slowness. The user asked me to execute commands, and I see that I can run terminal commands with the relevant tool. The environment is Windows PowerShell 7 at the specified path, but commands will run in the project’s shell. It’s crucial to propose commands carefully, ensuring they may require user approval, especially if they’re non-interactive. I think I should suggest commands to implement a lightweight prompt, optionally back up the existing profile, and modify oh-my-posh config for git status. However, I’m unsure if they're using posh-git or oh-my-posh, so maybe detection is needed.
**Planning PowerShell improvements**

I’m considering running commands to detect installed modules and which prompt is active. Although there are rules for automating GitHub issues, the current task focuses on the local environment. This is a multi-step approach: detect current prompt modules, back up the profile, apply a lightweight prompt, and potentially alter the oh-my-posh config to disable status. I’ll also need to disable posh-git for slower repos, and the workspace path might serve as a target repo. The user prefers responses in Chinese and wants summaries of command outputs and findings. I should use parallel tool calls for efficiency and remember to create a to-do plan!
**Executing PowerShell commands**

I need to run several commands as part of this task. First, I'll echo the $PROFILE path, ensure the directory exists, and back it up if it's already there. Then, I’ll check if posh-git or oh-my-posh is active by using `Get-Module`. I need to capture the full output while preserving indentation when appending the prompt function to the $PROFILE.

Quoting for Windows can be tricky, so I’ll prepare the content as a here-string for writing using `Add-Content` or `Set-Content`. Lastly, I’ll modify $GitPromptSettings to disable file status scanning for the repo path after ensuring posh-git is imported.
**Implementing PowerShell prompt**

The user previously mentioned a script for setting up $GitPromptSettings, which I'll add as planned. However, since I'm creating my own 'prompt' function, it will override posh-git's prompt, which is intentional. Still, if they later want to enable oh-my-posh, it could create a conflict.

For now, I'll initially implement a lightweight prompt while ensuring there's no duplication. To safely adjust the $PROFILE, I’ll comment out any posh-git or oh-my-posh initializations without knowing their exact content. My approach is to define my prompt function at the end, which allows re-enabling oh-my-posh later if desired while adding comment markers for easy removal.
**Planning PowerShell commands**

I have a plan for changes, including adjusting oh-my-posh config only if it's installed. If it is, I'll export the config to a file if it doesn't exist, modifying the JSON to set `display_status` and `fetch_status` to false. However, I don’t want to switch users to oh-my-posh since I'm focusing on a minimal prompt setup. I’ll create a to-do list that includes detecting the current prompt source, backing up $PROFILE, and ensuring posh-git settings to disable file status scanning. I've decided to run commands sequentially while allowing parallelization for detections. 

Each command will be prepared for execution, and I’ll include appropriate status updates as I progress. The first commands will check the environment and ensure the profile folder exists, followed by backing up and appending the ultra-light prompt. I’ll also measure the new prompt’s performance to ensure it’s efficient. I’ll bundle everything to keep the workflow organized and efficient!
**Executing PowerShell commands**

I'm planning to run several PowerShell commands to set up the environment. The first command will detect the current settings and loaded modules without depending much on the current directory. It will display information like the PowerShell version, profile path, and whether necessary modules are loaded.

After that, I'll backup the current profile and append an ultra-light prompt function. Then, I’ll add settings related to posh-git to disable file status scanning in a specific directory. Lastly, I'll dot-source the profile and measure prompt performance both inside and outside the targeted repo. I aim to run these commands sequentially, ensuring to update the user with status updates and summarize outputs. Let's get started!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Executing path adjustments**

I'm planning to programmatically establish the correct path in the current shell and back it up with a timestamp. I'll also append some function prompts and ensure the settings for Posh-Git are included. There's a potential conflict with "oh-my-posh" if the user has it in their profile, so I need to consider how to handle that. It seems like I should just define my prompt function at the end rather than removing "oh-my-posh." The user seems ready to proceed with execution!
**Running profile adjustments**

First, I plan to run a detection command in a subshell using PowerShell, which will provide details like the PSVersion. However, since that may not reflect the user's environment, I’m focusing on modifying the $PROFILE instead. It’s important to back up the original before I make changes. I’ll read the $PROFILE path and create necessary directories if they don’t already exist. Then, I’ll append my function and Posh-Git settings, ensuring I avoid any duplicates when rerunning this process.
**Implementing guard markers**

I’m planning to add guard markers in my code to manage content in an appended block. If the marker already exists, I’ll replace the content instead of just appending new information. If it doesn’t exist, I’ll proceed to append the content. This approach should help keep everything organized and avoid duplication. I want to ensure that the content is correctly updated based on what’s already there, so careful handling of these markers is key!
**Crafting the PowerShell script**

I’m putting together a PowerShell script that involves several steps. First, I’ll define the profile path and ensure the necessary directory exists. I’ll set up markers to identify where my changes start and end. I’ll create a block of code to adjust Posh-Git settings and define a custom prompt function for Git. If the profile path exists, I’ll back it up with a timestamp. After that, I’ll check if my markers are present and replace the corresponding section if they are; otherwise, I’ll append my content and reload the profile.
I'm planning to run a robust PowerShell sequence to update the profile and benchmark the prompt. First, I’ll ensure the backup of the profile exists and check if my marker is already there. If it's not, I'll append the necessary lines for the prompt and Posh-Git settings. After that, I’ll benchmark the prompt command execution to measure performance. I'll format everything, taking care of escaping issues and ensuring a single line for the command. Once completed, I'll update the TODO statuses to reflect progress.
**Implementing status updates**

I need to include status updates before running any tool calls, ensuring that I stick closely to the required output format. I’ll also summarize the command-line output at the end of each run to provide clear feedback on what was executed. This way, it’s easier to track progress and understand results. I’ll make sure all of this is done systematically, following the established process accurately throughout the workflow. Let's get started!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Following instructions for user commands**

I see that I need to follow the developer's instructions, which involve using status updates and running commands. The user mentioned "继续," but they previously canceled a run. So, I need to ask for their permission to proceed. The tool requires a proposed command, and I can re-run simpler commands to avoid technical issues. I also updated the todo list to reflect that I'm setting the write-prompt in progress. Keeping everything streamlined is essential!
**Planning to rerun commands**

I think we need to propose a safer way to rerun the commands by adjusting the quoting methods. Instead of using Add-Content with here-strings, I could echo lines individually or create temporary files. Additionally, I need to follow the user's rules to always respond in Chinese and provide a summary after the run. Despite previous cancellations, the user mentioned "继续," so I feel encouraged to proceed with the next steps, including backing up the profile and adding the necessary settings.
**Breaking down commands for reliability**

To ensure reliability, I think I should break tasks into smaller commands, like echoing the profile path, testing the path, copying the backup, and creating a minimal prompt function file separately before appending. I'll avoid interactive prompts and ensure I use the -Force option. Instead of working with $PROFILE, I could modify just the current session since persisting changes is necessary. I can also use "pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -Command" to manipulate the profile file path reliably. Let’s go through this step by step.
**Writing command sequence for tasks**

I need to write a series of commands for the task. First, I'll ensure the directory exists using `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force`. Then, I will create a backup if the directory already exists. For appending content, my snippet includes a function with double quotes, so I’ll need to handle escaping correctly. To avoid issues, I could write the content from base64. I'll also remember that previous cancellations were likely due to PSReadLine issues, which weren’t related to my command. Since the user said "继续," I can proceed, but I’ll include a status update first.
**Preparing to append commands safely**

I want to run the append process again but break it into two runs to minimize risk. After editing, I'll source the profile into the current session using "pwsh" to run ". $PROFILE". I'll measure the performance by using "Measure-Command" for the prompt, and then adjust the posh-git settings accordingly. Since the user typically uses posh-git in their profile, I'll handle any exceptions carefully. I'll manage backups and append snippets while ensuring everything is outputted clearly, including a checksum for safety.  I’ll also provide status updates throughout this process for better clarity.</details></think>

我将继续在你的环境中落地：先把超轻量 prompt 与 posh-git 精简设置安全地写入 $PROFILE（自动备份），随后重载并进行 10 次耗时测试并汇总平均值。现在开始执行。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating PowerShell quoting**

I'm considering how to use here-strings with PowerShell to avoid escaping issues. When using -Command, I have to be careful about conflicting quotes. Writing to a file in the repository could work, but I'd prefer not to write to the repo root. Using set-content -Append might simplify this by encoding with base64. I remember trying here-strings with single quotes before, which is fine, but I'm worried about interpreting quotes and dollar signs. Unclosed quotes may be causing hanging in the earlier attempts, especially with complex escaping for JSON and PowerShell.
**Planning terminal command execution**

I'm realizing that the wrapper function run_terminal_cmd only accepts a single line, which can complicate things. An easier approach might be to write a snippet to a separate file and call PowerShell to append to that file. It's fine to create that file in the project workspace, but I want to avoid putting config in the repo. Using a temporary file in %TEMP% seems like a solid backup plan. I'll use multiple run_terminal_cmd calls with one-liners, starting with determining the profile path. I can run PowerShell to print the $PROFILE path, but for later commands, I’d need to assign it within one command or compute it step by step.
**Creating robust PowerShell commands**

I want to set variables within the -Command while keeping commands short. Since the tool requires one command per invocation but allows multiple calls, that should work! First, I’ll print the profile path with: pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -Command "$PROFILE". Next, I’ll create the directory if it doesn’t exist using a command that checks and creates it.

For backing up, I’ll copy the profile if it exists. I'll generate a temporary file path using [System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName(), write the snippet content to it, and then append it to the profile using Add-Content. I’ll ensure the encoding is UTF8 for compatibility. Let's keep the snippet minimal yet effective!
**Crafting the PowerShell snippet**

I'm working on a PowerShell snippet for the prompt function, which checks the current Git branch and formats the prompt accordingly. The line with "$pwd..." uses double quotes, but I can avoid escaping by using a single-quoted here-string. As I plan to write it to a temp file with Set-Content, I need to embed the here-string content carefully. Using the @' ... '@ format inside the -Command should help me avoid double-escaping issues while keeping the overall length manageable, even if it ends up being lengthy.
**Implementing the prompt snippet**

I'm going for a streamlined approach to create a PowerShell snippet for the prompt function. Each -Command should be kept short, yet multiple lines can increase complexity. One strategy is using echo style with Set-Content to manage temporary files.

The first command writes the snippet to a temporary file; the second appends it to the user's profile. I'm careful about embedding quotes, and using here-strings allows me to include them without escaping issues. Lastly, I want to ensure the integrated shell reloads the profile properly in the user's current interactive environment without causing any problems like PSReadLine crashes. Let's keep it concise!
**Adjusting the prompt function**

I'm considering alternatives for creating and executing the prompt function in PowerShell. Instead of lengthy Base64 encoding or inlined strings, I think the best approach is to define a minimal prompt function directly in the current shell. 

I want to create a function that pulls the current Git branch or defaults to a simple prompt. I'll also consider posh-git settings, ensuring not to use too many long commands at once, especially since the user indicated issues with previous commands hanging. 

The final goal is to set this function first, test it, and eventually save it to the user's profile with simpler commands after confirming it's working!
**Crafting the prompt function**

I'm working on creating the PowerShell prompt function that includes the Git branch name correctly. The trickiest part is ensuring that the quotes around " [$branch]> " are handled well in the command string. 

To avoid confusion with nested quotes, I’ll structure my command to use double quotes for the entire string while escaping the necessary inner quotes. 

I'll also need to import the posh-git module and adjust settings in a single line, which might be a little lengthy but is necessary for brevity. Finally, I plan to append these changes persistently to the user’s profile.
**Planning the profile update**

I want to append the new prompt function to the user's profile using `Add-Content`, but embedding the function in a single string can get really complicated with all the quoting and escaping required. Given that the user wants to apply changes immediately, I think it’s best to go ahead and define the function in the current session first.

To reduce complexity, I'll create a new script file with the function and settings instead of modifying the profile directly. After that, I’ll append a single line to the profile to source the new script. This way, it keeps things simpler and avoids those quoting issues!
**Implementing session changes**

I want to set the new prompt function in the current PowerShell session first. The function line I need to write contains tricky single quotes, which would require extensive escaping if I use single quotes around the whole line. Instead, it would be simpler to use double quotes with backticks to escape necessary characters.

However, since variables like `$branch` and `$pwd` will expand prematurely, I must be careful and choose the right structure. Given the challenges with persisting changes, I'm opting to apply the current session changes first, then measure improvements, and finally ask the user if they want to persist those changes. Let's execute the commands and keep everything running smoothly!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring command execution issues**

I’m considering how to prepare simple commands that won't hang, avoiding things like `Write-Host`. The previous failures seemed to be related to "interrupted" events, possibly because of output piping. The run tool suggests avoiding newlines, and our initial command didn’t include them. However, braces or quotes might cause the tool to misinterpret prompts as waiting. One solution could be providing exact commands for the user, especially since the user asked to execute their commands directly.
**Addressing command execution challenges**

It seems like our tool isn't functioning properly. I could suggest minimal commands for the user to copy, but the developer guidelines allow us to run commands directly. If that's failing, I need to handle it gracefully. One better approach might be to use `-EncodedCommand` to avoid quoting problems in PowerShell. I can run a base64 encoded command without newlines, but quoting in the session prompt function can be tricky. Alternatively, I considered using `Set-Content` to update the profile, though there were issues with that before.
**Reassessing command execution strategies**

I'm considering another approach by avoiding function definitions. Instead, I think about setting the `prompt` variable. However, using `powershell -NoProfile -Command [scriptblock]` could lead to issues because it interacts with PSReadLine, which might cause hangs due to unmatched quotes. The tool shows ">>" prompts, indicating problems with multiline input. To avoid parsing issues, I need to ensure proper quote usage. Given the interference, it might be best to write the profile file using a filesystem write tool, but I don't have access to the user's local file system.
**Adapting to command execution limitations**

Since I can't use the filesystem write tool here, I need to instruct the user to run commands instead. Given the run tool is failing, my plan is to provide minimal commands for the user to paste in. Using base64 could help avoid quoting issues. I should also mark the "write-prompt" task as canceled since we can't run the commands, but I can still provide step-by-step instructions. The user requested to "继续," so I’ll propose straightforward commands they can run in their Terminal. The problem might be with the tool itself, but I'm aiming to help them navigate this!
**Planning command execution updates**

I need to propose shorter commands and ask the user for approval to run them. Since function.run_terminal_cmd executes directly, I must provide a status update before any tool calls. The user prefers responses in 中文, so I’ll keep it concise. I'll acknowledge the hang and suggest ultra-short commands, like disabling heavy posh-git scanning for the repo. However, quoting has been tricky, so I might offer step-by-step commands instead. 

I will guide the user to create a prompt function and adjust posh-git settings while marking our todo list updates as necessary since we can't execute directly. I'll also remind them to run commands in their local terminal.
**Updating execution plan and providing commands**

It looks like the tool execution encountered issues with newlines and escaping, causing a switch to multiline mode. I won’t run any more tools in this turn. Instead, I’ll keep the response brief but structured. 

I’ll explain the hang was due to quoting that caused PSReadLine to produce multiline prompts. So, I’ll present short commands for the user to paste directly into their PowerShell terminal, offering two options: 

A) For current session effect.  
B) For permanent effect.

I’ll include commands, a validation benchmark, rollback commands, and an optional oh-my-posh JSON snippet. I'll also add a brief status update: "我切换为提供命令." Finally, I’ll summarize everything with a bullet list.</details></think>

我看到命令在你的终端进入了多行输入模式（>>），这是因为引号/花括号在一行里被 PowerShell 解析成未闭合，导致“挂住”。我改为提供短小、可直接逐段粘贴执行的命令，避免再次卡住。

### 先在“当前会话”快速生效（不改文件）
- 定义超轻量 prompt（仅路径+分支名，零状态扫描）：
```powershell
function prompt {
    $branch = $(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>$null)
    "$pwd$([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($branch) ? '>' : " [$branch]> ")"
}
```
- 精简 posh-git 在当前仓库的扫描（若已安装）：
```powershell
Import-Module posh-git -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if ($null -ne $GitPromptSettings) {
    if (-not ($GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus -contains 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning')) {
        $GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus += 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning'
    }
    $GitPromptSettings.ShowStatusWhenZero = $false
}
```
- 验证耗时（取 10 次平均）：
```powershell
1..10 | % { (Measure-Command { prompt | Out-Null }).TotalMilliseconds } | Measure-Object -Average -Minimum -Maximum
```

### 永久生效（写入 $PROFILE，确保内容简单易粘贴）
- 打开配置文件：
```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```
- 在文件末尾粘贴以下两段（与上面一致）并保存：
```powershell
function prompt {
    $branch = $(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>$null)
    "$pwd$([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($branch) ? '>' : " [$branch]> ")"
}
```
```powershell
try { Import-Module posh-git -ErrorAction Stop } catch {}
if ($null -ne $GitPromptSettings) {
    if (-not ($GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus -contains 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning')) {
        $GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus += 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning'
    }
    $GitPromptSettings.ShowStatusWhenZero = $false
}
```
- 让更改立即生效：
```powershell
. $PROFILE
```

### 如果你在用 oh-my-posh（可选）
- 在你的 oh-my-posh 配置 JSON 的 `git` 段设置为：
```json
{
  "type": "git",
  "style": "plain",
  "properties": {
    "display_status": false,
    "fetch_status": false
  }
}
```

### 回退/切换
- 临时移除当前会话的自定义 prompt：
```powershell
Remove-Item function:prompt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```
- 需要时再手动加载 posh-git 或 oh-my-posh：
```powershell
Import-Module posh-git
# 或
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
```

请先按“当前会话生效”的两段命令粘贴执行，然后贴一下测速的结果（Average/Min/Max）。如果没有问题，再按“永久生效”写入 $PROFILE。 
- 我后续可根据你的测速结果，继续帮你精简或恢复到你希望的显示粒度。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying status updates**

I think we need to provide status updates based on the developer tool guidance. However, since we're not calling tools right now, I need to consider if a status update is still necessary. The status update specification says to give updates only during tool calls. Since we're not in that situation, I could just respond normally. We have a to-do list, and I shouldn't mark tasks as done until they're executed. The focus is on helping the user leave editing mode quickly, so I'll propose the next steps clearly.
**Clarifying prompt function guidance**

I’m thinking about defining a prompt function with semicolons to keep it as a single line. One good one-liner could look like this: 

function prompt { $b=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>$null); "$pwd$([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($b) ? '>' : \" [$b]> \")" }.

Quoting gets messy, so maybe I should suggest using single quotes for the outer string. It adds complexity, though, especially with double quotes in the brackets.

I also want to ensure the user knows how to exit editing mode clearly. If they started here-string with @', they should finish it with '@ alone on a line; otherwise, for a function block, they need to add a } to exit.
**Providing clear exit instructions**

I want to give concise steps for the user, likely dealing with an open here-string due to a long command with $snippet=@' ... '@. I should tell them to directly input `'@` on a new line and hit enter. If they used @" instead, then they should type `"@`.

If they're unsure, they can start by pressing Ctrl+C. For an open function block, they need to input `}`. If they’re really stuck, typing `exit` closes the terminal, but pressing Ctrl+Shift+V isn't necessary.

To help them identify the situation, I might mention that if the last lines include "@';" or "function prompt {", it indicates the here-string isn’t closed yet. Finally, I'll suggest they type `'@` first to close the here-string and reassure them about resuming once they're back at the regular prompt.
**Finalizing command format**

I’m considering how to present the final answer without using heavy code fences, but it's acceptable for commands. I'll make sure to include the exact tokens to keep it clear for the user. I'll focus on being concise and straightforward so the response is easy to follow. No need for excessive formatting; that could complicate things. The goal is to provide a clean and clear final response that’s helpful for the user.</details></think>

你现在卡在 PowerShell 的多行“编辑模式”（>>）。按下面顺序退出：

- 最可能的原因：之前用了 here-string（看得到 `$snippet=@'`）。请在新的一行单独输入：
```
'@
```
然后回车。若当时是 `@"` 开头，则输入：
```
"@
```

- 如果是函数体没闭合：在新的一行输入：
```
}
```

- 若是引号没闭合：补上缺失的 `'` 或 `"` 后回车。

- 还不行：按 Ctrl+C 取消当前输入；实在不行就输入 `exit` 关闭该终端标签，再开一个新的。

- [ ] 提供一键恢复与切换命令

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Examining here-string errors**

I see the error message states that no characters should follow a here-string header before the line ends. This means the header should end with @" or @', and closed by "@" or "' at the start. There's an issue with Chinese quotes in line 78 causing a parser error. I think the best method is to instruct them to avoid here-string inputs and to use simple one-liners, or edit $PROFILE in Notepad instead.
**Creating session commands**

I need to run short commands for in-session changes, like defining a prompt function and configuring posh-git. It’s important to provide commands with single quotes to avoid nested quoting issues. However, the prompt string includes double quotes, which complicates things a bit. I can programmatically build the string to avoid extensive quoting. The function can be defined as a one-liner that handles variable expansions properly while avoiding curly brace issues. Let's keep the structure balanced and clear!
**Adjusting posh-git settings**

For the posh-git settings, I’ll start by importing the module. Then, I’ll check if the GitPromptSettings exist and update them to disable file status for a specific directory. To keep things simple, I can break this into two one-liners using semicolons for clarity. I think I should also benchmark the prompt command to see its performance. Additionally, I’ll remind users to use standard ASCII quotes to avoid errors, and it might be best for them to run commands manually for now.
**Guiding the user through commands**

The user mentioned they had issues with commands before and now want guidance. I think it's best to provide clear instructions rather than executing complex commands myself, especially since they're using Windows PowerShell 7.5.2 which has a PSReadLine bug. I’ll recommend they clear the editing mode and execute three specific commands instead. They also expressed frustration with error messages, so I need to offer direct fixes. Additionally, we might need to correct the todo statuses that weren't marked correctly before.
**Providing clear steps**

The user is dealing with an error and needs guidance on how to exit editing mode and proceed. I need to give a short explanation that the error arises from here-string headers and typographic quotes. I'll explain how to exit editing by typing "@", or pressing Ctrl+C. 

Then, I’ll provide three one-liners for this session: defining a minimal prompt function, applying posh-git settings if the module exists, and benchmarking the prompt. 

To make settings persistent, I'll recommend using Notepad to edit $PROFILE, ensuring they paste the necessary blocks, and save in UTF-8. Simple and concise!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating task statuses**

I need to update the statuses on the to-do list. I've completed the tasks for poshgit-tweak and reloaded and benchmarked, so I can check those off. I've already done the measurements too! The next step is to create persistent profile write and jot down recovery notes. It’s important to keep everything organized, ensuring I don’t forget these critical tasks. Let’s make sure we stay on top of this!
**Proposing file creation commands**

I’m thinking about how we should create a file using concise commands. First, we can get the profile path and ensure the directory exists with `New-Item`. I want to avoid issues with here-strings when adding content, so I’ll use `Out-File -Append` with UTF-8 encoding and single-line strings. Alternatively, I can append lines one by one with `Add-Content`. 

Let’s go with these commands for efficiency! Then we can source the file to apply the changes.
**Escaping characters in strings**

I need to ensure proper handling of the `$` sign in strings. Inside double quotes, they expand, so it's safer to use single-quoted strings and double the single quotes when needed. Most of our strings are single-quoted, but the one with `$GitPromptSettings` shouldn't expand `$`. Single quotes don’t expand variables in PowerShell, so I can include `$` directly. However, when I have `'D:\SummerVacationPlanning'` within a single-quoted string, I must escape it by doubling the single quotes. I might also consider using double quotes for the outer string to simplify things.
**Simplifying string handling**

I’m noticing that using inner single quotes around things like `' '` creates complexity when writing it inside a single-quoted string. To include a single quote, I have to double it, which can quickly become messy. It might be better to simplify things to avoid confusion and maintain clarity. I should consider how to structure my strings to minimize the need for escaping characters so I can keep everything clean and straightforward!
**Creating profile and offering steps**

It seems there was an error due to the profile path not existing. I’ll guide the user to create the profile directory and file while opening Notepad. For that, I'll provide clear commands:

1) Create the directory and file, then open Notepad:

```powershell
$pf=$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost; $dir=Split-Path -Parent $pf; if(-not (Test-Path $dir)){ New-Item -Type Directory -Path $dir -Force | Out-Null }; if(-not (Test-Path $pf)){ New-Item -Type File -Path $pf -Force | Out-Null }; notepad $pf
```

After opening, the user can paste the two blocks from earlier. I noted an average response time of 111 ms, which is decent! If there are still performance issues, adjustments can be made.</details></think>

---

- 你看到的是“系统找不到指定的路径”，因为 `$PROFILE` 的目录/文件还没创建。先用以下短命令创建目录和空文件，再用记事本打开：

```powershell
$pf = $PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost
$dir = Split-Path -Parent $pf
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dir -Force | Out-Null
if (-not (Test-Path $pf)) { New-Item -ItemType File -Path $pf -Force | Out-Null }
notepad $pf
```

- 在打开的文件末尾粘贴这两段，保存：

```powershell
function prompt {
    $b = (git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>$null)
    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($b)) { (Get-Location).Path + '> ' }
    else { (Get-Location).Path + ' [' + $b + ']> ' }
}
```

```powershell
try { Import-Module posh-git -ErrorAction Stop } catch {}
if ($null -ne $GitPromptSettings) {
    if (-not ($GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus -contains 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning')) {
        $GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus += 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning'
    }
    $GitPromptSettings.ShowStatusWhenZero = $false
}
```

- 立即生效并复测：
```powershell
. $PROFILE
1..10 | % { (Measure-Command { $null = prompt }).TotalMilliseconds } | Measure-Object -Average -Minimum -Maximum | Format-List
```

- 你刚才的测速结果：Average ≈ 111.6 ms（Min ≈ 100.5，Max ≈ 127）。如需再提速，我们可以去掉 posh-git（只保留上面的轻量 prompt），或在 oh-my-posh 中关闭 Git 段状态显示。

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering git optimization**

I think they might not have the oh-my-posh init set up, using Windows Terminal or VS Code with PSReadLine instead. I need to measure process time for running functions and evaluating git symbolic-ref each time. In a large repository, “git symbolic-ref --short HEAD” is fast, maybe 2-5ms, but 100ms seems suspicious. It could be the antivirus scanning git.exe. To optimize, it’s better to read the HEAD file directly from .git/HEAD instead of calling an external process each time.
**Simplifying branch name retrieval**

Okay, I'm working on a function to get the branch name from git. First, I need to check if the HEAD path exists and then read its content. If it matches 'ref: ', I can construct the path to get the branch name. It would be simpler to just parse it as 'refs/heads/xxxx'. This should speed things up, with new measurement expected around 1-2ms. I think about updating the prompt to read from .git/HEAD and focusing on minimal caching for efficiency.
**Streamlining the prompt function**

I noticed they imported posh-git, but I want to keep my custom prompt function as is. I’ll provide a minimal code snippet for defining the new prompt function inline and include a test measure. There's also an optional speed improvement by prewarming the git.exe path with Start-Process, but that might not be necessary. I should suggest fully disabling posh-git and oh-my-posh to enhance speed; the user can easily remove the posh-git module and re-measure. Lastly, I’ll consider updating the TODO status based on earlier tool calls, but right now, it isn’t needed.
**Considering status updates**

I think I should include a status update even if I’m not using tools right now. The status update specification suggests writing updates before and after batches of tool calls, but I can still provide a brief update. It might be helpful to include a short bullet for clarity. Also, I'll need to ensure that I present the code fences correctly and only include the necessary minimal code. This way, everything remains clear and organized for the user!</details></think>

我看到了你的测速：Average ≈ 112 ms。说明瓶颈在每次 prompt 都调用一次 git.exe。我们换成“不调用 git，仅读取 .git/HEAD”的极速方案，再测一次。

- 在当前会话粘贴执行（两段）：
```powershell
function Get-GitBranchFast {
    $p = (Get-Location).Path
    while ($p -and -not (Test-Path (Join-Path $p '.git'))) {
        $parent = [System.IO.Directory]::GetParent($p); if (-not $parent) { return $null }
        $p = $parent.FullName
    }
    if (-not $p) { return $null }
    $head = Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath (Join-Path $p '.git\HEAD') -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    if ($head -match 'refs/heads/(.+)') { $Matches[1] } else { $null }
}
function prompt {
    $b = Get-GitBranchFast
    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($b)) { (Get-Location).Path + '> ' }
    else { (Get-Location).Path + ' [' + $b + ']> ' }
}
```

- 复测：
```powershell
1..10 | % { (Measure-Command { $null = prompt }).TotalMilliseconds } | Measure-Object -Average -Minimum -Maximum | Format-List
```

- 如还想再榨干一点：临时移除 posh-git（不影响上面的 prompt）后再测一次对比：
```powershell
Remove-Module posh-git -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

如果这次平均值能降到个位数/十几毫秒内，我再帮你把这套方案写入 `$PROFILE`。

It seems it’s not necessary to make tool calls here. I’ll provide a brief summary at the end that captures what changed and its impact.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering string formatting**

I realize that we need to use single quotes for strings. However, since I'm already using single quotes for the content, any single quotes within that content need to be doubled up to escape them properly. It's almost like a little puzzle, and I want to make sure I get this right! It'll help avoid any confusion or errors in the code. Just need to keep track of the escaping rules!
**Planning script content**

I’m organizing the content for a PowerShell script. I’ll create a function called `Get-GitBranchFast`, which will help find the current Git branch by navigating up directories. If it finds the `.git` directory, it retrieves the HEAD information. Next, I’ll have a `prompt` function to customize the command prompt based on the current Git branch. I also need to tweak the `posh-git` module import and manage Git settings, especially regarding repository-specific settings. Finally, breaking up the `Add-Content` lines helps avoid using here-strings.
**Formatting content lines**

I need to add content with two blank lines followed by a header comment. Each line will be embedded as a single-quoted literal to avoid any interpolation. While I need single quotes inside the content, like '.git' and 'refs/heads/(.+)', this could cause conflicts. In PowerShell, to handle single quotes within a single-quoted string, I’ll have to double them up: handling it as '' will be crucial for clarity and avoiding syntax errors. Such attention to detail really matters!
**Adding content to script**

I'm adding lines to create a PowerShell script step by step. First, I'll insert a blank line, followed by a header comment to indicate the start of the fast Git prompt functionality. Then, I’ll define the `Get-GitBranchFast` function, which will look for the current Git branch in the directory structure. I carefully include syntax for checking paths and handling cases where the `.git` folder might not be found. It’s important to maintain proper formatting with escaped quotes!
**Implementing PowerShell commands**

I'm working on adding content to the PowerShell profile script. First, I'll finalize the Git prompt function and import the `posh-git` module, adding configurations as needed. To keep things organized, I’ll plan to implement commands where each command can be chained with semicolons to ensure a streamlined execution. 

I’ll also include backup functionality for the profile, ensuring directory existence, and setting up micro-updates on progress. Finally, I’ll reload the profile, measure performance, and provide status updates to track the script's progress. It’s a thorough approach to ensure everything runs smoothly!</details></think>

我会把刚才的“极速分支名 prompt”持久化到 $PROFILE：先创建/备份，再追加配置，然后重载并测速。接下来我会分三条很短的命令执行，避免卡在多行模式。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating tasks and formatting**

I need to ensure we have the Windows path formatted correctly and are using plain quotes with CRLF. Code blocks using markdown are also necessary. I’ll provide a summary, and we should update the todos with `merge=true` to complete the `reload-and-benchmark` and `recovery-notes`. Even though there are no tool calls in this message, I can still call `todo_write` to mark them as completed. I’ll include a status update as required before running the merges.
**Clarifying next steps**

We’re not actually editing or benchmarking right now, but we can mark the `reload-and-benchmark` task as pending while we ask them to reload and run. Earlier, we attempted to update $PROFILE using a child process, but it didn’t run. I’ll instruct them to do it manually by running `. $PROFILE` and measuring the results. It sounds like the user wants to proceed, so I’ll prepare instructions for pasting and reloading without marking as completed until they confirm. I can also mark `recovery-notes` as completed afterward.
**Planning safe instructions**

It's better to guide them to manually paste content. Since the environment is interactive, I’ll give them straightforward CLI commands that won’t hang. 

I can suggest using `Set-Content` to append safe blocks from a file. I might create a temporary `.ps1` file in the workspace with the function code and then run a short command to append this content to $PROFILE. While it’s outside allowed directories, I can still create a temp file in the workspace for this purpose. This will also minimize the quoting issues we encountered earlier.
**Proposing a file creation strategy**

I’m thinking of creating a file named `D:\SummerVacationPlanning\_prompt_fast.ps1` to store the two functions using the mcp filesystem write tool. Since I can write files in allowed directories, I’ll follow up with some terminal commands.

The command will ensure the profile directory exists, then append the file contents to the profile and reload it. Although the initial command might seem long, splitting it into three smaller, manageable commands can help: 1) Create the file, 2) Check the profile directory, and 3) Append the content and reload. Time to implement this!
**Implementing commands step-by-step**

I need to run two terminal commands: first, to ensure the directory exists, and second, to append content. The command will set the profile and directory, and if the directory doesn't exist, it will create one before adding markers and the content from `_prompt_fast.ps1`.

To simplify the process, I can split this into three smaller commands for clarity and manageability. Also, the user expressed concerns about why things appeared stalled. I’ll explain that it’s due to a PSReadLine bug and quoting issues. Let’s move ahead with writing the file and executing the necessary commands in parallel.</details></think>

我不再用超长一行命令，改为先在项目里写入一个 `_prompt_fast.ps1` 脚本，再用三条很短的命令把它追加到 `$PROFILE` 并重载与测速，避免再次卡住。现在开始创建脚本并执行三步。

          <summary>MCP tool call</summary>
      
*Called tool*: filesystem - write_file: Create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content. Use with caution as it will overwrite existing files without warning. Handles text content with proper encoding. Only works within allowed directories.

*Parameters*:
  * path: D:\SummerVacationPlanning\_prompt_fast.ps1
  * content: # fast prompt config
function Get-GitBranchFast {
    $p = (Get-Location).Path
    while ($p -and -not (Test-Path (Join-Path $p '.git'))) {
        $parent = [System.IO.Directory]::GetParent($p); if (-not $parent) { return $null }
        $p = $parent.FullName
    }
    if (-not $p) { return $null }
    $head = Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath (Join-Path $p '.git\HEAD') -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    if ($head -match 'refs/heads/(.+)') { $Matches[1] } else { $null }
}
function prompt {
    $b = Get-GitBranchFast
    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($b)) { (Get-Location).Path + '> ' }
    else { (Get-Location).Path + ' [' + $b + ']> ' }
}
# optional: soften posh-git cost for this repo if loaded
try { Import-Module posh-git -ErrorAction Stop } catch {}
if ($null -ne $GitPromptSettings) {
    if (-not ($GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus -contains 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning')) {
        $GitPromptSettings.RepositoriesInWhichToDisableFileStatus += 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning'
    }
    $GitPromptSettings.ShowStatusWhenZero = $false
}


*Result*:
Successfully wrote to D:\SummerVacationPlanning\_prompt_fast.ps1

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Confirming next steps**

The user mentioned "又停住了," which suggests something may have stopped. Instead of running more commands, I should suggest running a few very short commands manually and then confirm with the user. Also, I successfully created _prompt_fast.ps1 using the filesystem write tool! It’s important to keep things simple and make sure the user is clear on how to proceed before doing anything else.
**Advising manual steps for $PROFILE**

I need to guide the user on how to add to their $PROFILE by suggesting simple echo commands or using a one-liner for dot sourcing. It seems like there’s been some confusion due to previous attempts, especially with the powershell command replacing expansions incorrectly. 

First, let's ensure the $PROFILE path is correct and print it using `$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost`. Then, I can recommend opening Notepad at that path. If the path doesn't exist, creating it will show a message about the path not being found.
**Simplifying $PROFILE editing**

It looks like there was tokenization confusion likely due to a long line being wrapped or copied incorrectly, and this seems to have affected quoting. I want to provide a simpler approach for the user. The best way might be to manually edit $PROFILE using Visual Studio Code or Notepad.

I can suggest they open PowerShell and use: `$pf=$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost; $dir=Split-Path -Parent $pf; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dir -Force; notepad $pf`. After that, they can paste the line: `. 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning\_prompt_fast.ps1'` using something like Add-Content to avoid complex quoting issues.
**Finalizing todo list tasks**

I notice our todo list still has tasks like "reload-and-benchmark in_progress" and "recovery-notes pending." We can prompt the user to run the last steps, and since we can't call tools, I think we can still use the todo_write tool without causing terminal issues. 

I’ll instruct the user to manually add the necessary lines to their $PROFILE, then run the measurement. We could also suggest optional restore commands for "恢复原有 prompt." Plus, I’ll include a command to "退出编辑模式" in case they get stuck again.
**Crafting user instructions**

I need to explain the issue here: it seems the long command combined with a here-string is causing a PSReadLine exception. A safe approach is to suggest using Notepad to add the necessary dot-source line.

Here are the steps:  
1) Confirm the path of the already created _prompt_fast.ps1 and remind the user it exists.  
2) Check if the profile directory is needed, and open Notepad with the command: `$pf=$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost; $dir=Split-Path -Parent $pf; if(-not(Test-Path $dir)){New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dir -Force | Out-Null}; notepad $pf`.  

3) Have them manually paste the line: `. 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning\_prompt_fast.ps1'`.  
4) Save and reload using: `. $PROFILE`.  
5) For benchmarking, they can run: `1..10 | % { (Measure-Command { $null = prompt }).TotalMilliseconds } | Measure-Object -Average -Minimum -Maximum | Format-List`.  
6) Optionally, they may disable posh-git with: `Remove-Module posh-git -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`.  
7) For recovery options, to disable the new prompt for the session, use: `Remove-Item function:prompt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`, or delete the line from the profile to stop dot-sourcing in future sessions.

I'll remind them to use straight English quotes and not Chinese punctuation as well. And we can mention, "已创建 D:\SummerVacationPlanning\_prompt_fast.ps1," to reassure them!</details></think>

我看到卡住的原因是超长一行命令触发了 PowerShell 的换行/编辑模式和转义问题。我们改成“手动追加一行”的方式，最稳妥不再卡。

- `_prompt_fast.ps1` 我已放在 `D:\SummerVacationPlanning\_prompt_fast.ps1`。

请按下面三步操作（逐条执行）：
1) 打开/创建配置文件
```powershell
$pf = $PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost
$dir = Split-Path -Parent $pf
if (-not (Test-Path $dir)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dir -Force | Out-Null }
notepad $pf
```
2) 在文件末尾“单独一行”手动粘贴这句并保存（注意英文直引号）：
```powershell
. 'D:\SummerVacationPlanning\_prompt_fast.ps1'
```
3) 让配置生效并测速
```powershell
. $PROFILE
1..10 | % { (Measure-Command { $null = prompt }).TotalMilliseconds } | Measure-Object -Average -Minimum -Maximum | Format-List
```

可选再提速（不影响我们新 prompt）：
```powershell
Remove-Module posh-git -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

恢复/撤销：
- 本会话临时移除：```Remove-Item function:prompt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue```
- 永久取消：到 `$PROFILE` 删除刚才那一行并保存，然后执行 ```. $PROFILE```。

请按上面三步做完，把测速的 Average/Min/Max 发我，我再确认是否需要进一步优化。
