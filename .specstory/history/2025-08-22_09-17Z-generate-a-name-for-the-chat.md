<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Verifying CLI installation**

I think the CLI could be 'claude' if I install it with the command 'npm i -g claude-ai,' but I'm not certain since it's not official. To be sure, I should use web search to verify the current information about this installation process. I'll get started on that search so I can provide accurate details!</details></think>

我先查一下 Windows 上是否有官方的 “claude” 命令行工具以及正确的安装方式，然后给你一键可运行的安装/诊断命令。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating the 'claude' CLI**

I know the user has a rule in Chinese to create GitHub issues, but that's not the request here. They showed a terminal error with 'claude' not recognized, and they seem to want to use the 'claude' command. Previously, I planned to search for an official "claude" CLI but got a placeholder instead. The user is using Windows PowerShell, so I'll continue my exploration, considering open-source options like Hayden Bleasel's CLI or the Anthropic Python SDK.
**Exploring the Claude CLI Options**

I’m trying to figure out the different options for the user regarding "Claude Desktop" and CLI. Anthropic launched "Claude Desktop" for both macOS and Windows, but there's no specific 'claude' binary for CLI. There’s an npm CLI from 'saintplay'. If the user wants "Claude Desktop," they should install it from the site since it can't run in the terminal. For CLI options, I could suggest "aicli" from simonw or an "anthropic" Python wrapper. I should verify the installation commands, possibly using winget for Windows, and I plan to search again with the Brave tool.
**Running Parallel Searches**

I’m planning to use the multi_tool_use.parallel method to run a few searches simultaneously. First, I want to look for the winget package named 'Claude'. Then, I’ll search for terms like "Anthropic Claude winget" and "Claude Desktop Windows winget id" to get precise information. Lastly, I’ll also search for "claude npm cli." By running these searches in parallel, I hope to gather all the relevant details quickly!</details></think>

我先并行查下在 Windows 上是否有官方的 “claude” CLI 或可通过 winget 安装的包，以及第三方可用的 claude CLI 方案，马上给出可执行安装命令。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Proceeding with diagnostics**

I need to be cautious about making any system changes without the user’s consent. The instructions state that I can run commands, but approval is necessary. So, I’ll propose the commands before executing them. They encountered an error after typing `claude`, and I can help by running diagnostics. Minimal risk commands like version checks will be my first step. I’ll ensure to include a status update before executing multiple commands in parallel and summarize the output later.</details></think>

我先在当前 PowerShell 里做环境自检（Node/npm/路径），以确定为何 `claude` 命令不可用。随后根据结果给出一键安装/修复命令。
