2. **Proper scaling** from 320px to 768px widths
3. **Readable typography** at all tested screen sizes
4. **No layout breaking** or element overlap issues

## Backend Integration Testing

### Connection Issues Identified
- **Backend server not running** during testing (port 5000)
- **"Failed to fetch" errors** displayed properly in UI
- **Error handling** works correctly on mobile devices
- **Graceful degradation** when backend is unavailable

### Recommendations for Backend Testing
1. **Start backend server** before comprehensive testing
2. **Test API integration** with mobile network conditions
3. **Validate error message display** on different screen sizes
4. **Test offline/poor connectivity scenarios**

## Performance Metrics

### Network Performance Testing
| Device | Load Time (Slow Network) | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------------------------|--------|-------|
| iPhone 12 | <6 seconds | ‚úÖ PASS | Good performance on simulated 3G |
| Galaxy S21 | <6 seconds | ‚úÖ PASS | Consistent with iPhone performance |
| iPad | <6 seconds | ‚úÖ PASS | Slightly better due to larger screen |

### Key Performance Insights:
- **Acceptable load times** even with 100ms network delays
- **No performance degradation** on smaller screens
- **Efficient resource loading** across all devices

## Accessibility Assessment

### Current Accessibility Status
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Proper button labeling and text content
- Adequate touch target sizes (32-44px+)
- Good color contrast maintained
- Form fields have appropriate labels

‚ùå **Issues Identified:**
- **Missing H1 heading** structure for screen readers
- No semantic heading hierarchy detected
- Limited ARIA labels on interactive elements

### Accessibility Recommendations
1. **Add semantic HTML structure** with proper H1/H2/H3 hierarchy
2. **Implement ARIA labels** for screen reader accessibility
3. **Test with screen reader software** on mobile devices
4. **Add skip navigation links** for keyboard users

## Rewards Center Specific Testing

### Authentication Flow Testing
- **Login form responsive** across all device sizes
- **Demo credentials integration** tested (requires backend)
- **Error messaging** displays appropriately
- **Form validation** maintains mobile-friendly appearance

### Expected Rewards Center Features (Backend Required)
- Points display optimization for mobile screens
- Reward item cards with touch-friendly layouts
- Tab navigation for reward history/exchange
- Mobile-optimized action buttons

## Critical Issues & Recommendations

### üî¥ Critical Issues
1. **Backend Connectivity Required**
   - Unable to test complete rewards center functionality
   - Login/authentication flows need backend server
   - API integration testing incomplete

### üü° Medium Priority Issues
